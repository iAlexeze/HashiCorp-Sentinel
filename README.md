# Sentinel Policies Repository
Welcome to the Sentinel Policies Repository! This repository contains a collection of Sentinel policies and related files to enforce specific rules and restrictions within your infrastructure. Sentinel is a powerful policy-as-code framework that allows you to define and enforce policies across various aspects of your applications and infrastructure.

## Directory Structure

### README.md: 
This file provides an overview and instructions for using the Sentinel Policies Repository.

### policy.sentinel: 
This file contains a sample policy that checks if the current day is a weekday and if the current hour is within open hours (between 8 AM and 5 PM). It showcases how to define rules and conditions in Sentinel.

### test: 
This directory contains a test directory for policy-related files.

### policy: 
This directory contains policy-specific test files.

### policytest.hcl: 
This file provides a test scenario for the policy.sentinel policy. It defines global variables for the day and hour to test the policy against specific values.
### test.sentinel: 
This file contains another sample policy that checks if the current hour is past midnight (hour is greater than or equal to 0) and before noon (hour is less than 3). It demonstrates how to define rules with multiple conditions in Sentinel.

# Getting Started
To use the Sentinel policies and leverage their enforcement capabilities, follow these steps:

    -   Clone the repository to your local machine or workspace.

    -   Review the documentation and README file to understand the purpose and usage of the policies and related files.

    -   Customize the policies or create new policies based on your specific requirements. 
        Modify the rules and conditions to enforce the desired behaviors or restrictions in your infrastructure.

    -   Test the policies using the provided test scenarios. 
        Adjust the test variables or create new test scenarios to validate the policies against different conditions and edge cases.

    -   Integrate the policies into your deployment pipelines, infrastructure-as-code workflows, or other relevant processes to enforce policy compliance and ensure adherence to defined rules.

    -   Monitor the policy enforcement, review policy violations, and take necessary actions to remediate non-compliant resources or configurations.

#### Please note that the policies provided in this repository serve as examples and starting points. You should customize them or create new policies to suit your specific infrastructure, security, and compliance requirements.
